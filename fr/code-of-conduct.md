## Owner 
HR

## A Note
In general, we *expect*(presume) that everyone is an adult in our organization and will naturally, without any change in their behaviour, be able to conduct themselves within the guidelines. These guidelines exist to make that intrinsic behaviour explicit.

##Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standard Behaviour
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include, but are not limited to:

  * Using welcoming and inclusive language
  * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
  * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
  * Focusing on what is best for the community
  * Showing empathy towards other community members

## Unacceptable Behaviour
Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include, but are not limited to:

  * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
  * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
  * Yelling or aggressive tones
  * Personal insults
  * Threats
  * Dismissive response
  * Public or private harassment
  * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
  * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
HR is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Everyone has the responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to immediately ban, temporarily or permanently, any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. After you must contact HR of your actions and the reasons for them.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies both within private spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing us. Examples of representing us include, but are not limited to:
  * Using an official project e-mail address
  * Posting via an official social media account
  * Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
  * Videos, blogs, meetups, etc

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at HR. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
